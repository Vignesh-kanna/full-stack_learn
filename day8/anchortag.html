           A toast provides simple feedback about an operation in a small popup. It only fills the amount of space required for the 
           message and the current activity remains visible and interactive. Toasts automatically disappear after a timeout.</p> 
<p>For example, clicking Send on an email triggers a "Sending message..." toast Toasts are generally used to display simple
     notifications like: "Form submitted successfully" </p>
<p> "No internet connection" When to Use Toasts: </p>
<p id="the"> Informing users of background tasks (e.g., "File uploaded").  Providing quick status updates (e.g., "Logged in successfully"). 
 Displaying non-critical notifications that don't require a response Alerting users about temporary events (e.g., "Low battery"). 
 How to display Toast in Android: </p> 
 <p>When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending .py indicates that the file is a Python program. Your editor then runs the file through the 
Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what each word in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees 
the word print, it prints to the screen whatever is inside the parentheses.As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of 
your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that print is the name of a function and displays that word in blue. It recognizes that “Hello 
Python world!” is not Python code and displays that phrase in orange. This feature is called syntax highlighting and is quite useful as you start to write 
your own programs.</p>
<p>The output at u reports that an error occurs in line 2 of the file hello_world.py. The interpreter shows this line to help us spot the error 
quickly v and tells us what kind of error it found w. In this case it found a name error and reports that the variable being printed, mesage, has not been 
defined. Python can’t identify the variable name provided. A name error usually means we either forgot to set a variable’s value before using it, or 
we made a spelling mistake when entering the variable’s name. Of course, in this example we omitted the letter s in the variable name 
message in the second line. The Python interpreter doesn’t spellcheck your code, but it does ensure that variable names are spelled consistently. For 
example, watch what happens when we spell message incorrectly in another place in the code as well</p>

<p> Because most programs define and gather some sort of data, and then do something useful with it, it helps to classify different types of data. The first 
data type we’ll look at is the string. Strings are quite simple at first glance, but you can use them in many different ways.
 A string is simply a series of characters. Anything inside quotes is considered a string in Python, and you can use single or double quotes around 
your strings like this: </p>
